This folder contains details of the nodes in the clusters generated by the fast greedy community. Consider looking at Amazon0302-Communities(fg).txt to gain a brief idea of the stats (and at FG11LPCommunities and FG11WCCommunities at the communities formed oncluster 11 of fg after running label propagation and walktrap community finding algorithms) 

The files FG[0-9]+WithDetails contain the product ids as well as the title and category in that particular cluster.

The files Fg[0-9]+Lp[0-9]+WithDetails contain details of the products in the label propagation cluster on the induced subgraph formed by fast greedy clustering on the original graph. 


The files Fg[0-9]+Wc[0-9]+WithDetails contain details of the products in the walktrap cluster on the induced subgraph formed by fast greedy clustering on the original graph. 

The detail files were generated from the files w/o detail (for instance fg11lp76) by running the ClusterNodes.java file on the former.
